## Dataset
- Processed a dataset with 101000 records and 33 features
- Applied comprehensive preprocessing including handling missing values and normalization

## Clustering Analysis
- Used internal validation metrics to determine optimal cluster count: 7
- Silhouette Score: 0.2091
- Created detailed cluster profiles showing distinct university groupings

## Regression Analysis
- Predicted Average Pay using multiple models
- Best model: SVR with R² Score of 0.6092
- Most important features: kmeans_cluster, Tuition Fee (USD/year), Placement Rate (%)

## Recommendation System
- Created a system that recommends universities based on student profiles
- Recommendations show 93.27% higher placement rates
- Recommendations show -27.25% higher salaries

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to:
1. Identify natural groupings of universities
2. Predict important outcomes like graduate salaries
3. Create personalized recommendations for students

All validation was performed using internal metrics without requiring external ground truth sources.
